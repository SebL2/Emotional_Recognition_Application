frameworks:

Pytorch
TensorFlow?


OpenCV
DeepFace

Try training my own? take in images and convert into tensor
parse tensor through network to figure out emotion

use existing faces as target tensors (WIDERFACE database)
build network through this? back propogation aftewards to minimize error

after training, use model to detect emotion from captured image
